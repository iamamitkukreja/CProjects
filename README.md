# CProjects
Welcome to the Basic C Programs repository created by Amit Kukreja!

This repository contains a collection of basic programs written in C language. The programs included here cover a range of topics including data types, loops, conditional statements, functions, and arrays.

These programs are intended to serve as examples for beginners learning the C language, and also as a reference for more experienced programmers.

Each program in this repository is well-commented and easy to understand. Additionally, the code is properly formatted and adheres to best practices.

Feel free to download, modify, and use these programs in your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.

Thank you for visiting this repository and happy coding!
